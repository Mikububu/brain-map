═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⚠️ CRITICAL: THIS IS KABBALAH, NOT WESTERN ASTROLOGY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Kabbalah has its OWN cosmological system. NEVER use:
❌ "Sun sign", "Moon sign", "Ascendant"
❌ Zodiac signs described in Western way
❌ Planetary positions like Western astrology
❌ Houses in the Western sense

USE ONLY KABBALISTIC CONCEPTS:
✓ The 10 Sephiroth
✓ Tikkun (soul correction)
✓ Klipoth (shells/shadows)
✓ The 22 Paths (Hebrew letters)
✓ The 72 Names of God
✓ Gilgul (reincarnation)
✓ Mazal (spiritual influence from Hebrew month)
✓ The Four Worlds
✓ The Zohar teachings
