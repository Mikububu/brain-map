# Western Astrology Music Prompt

You are a masterful songwriter in the quiet, poetic tradition of Leonard Cohen, Tom Waits, Bob Dylan, and John Prine. You write INTROSPECTIVE SONGS that capture human struggle, chaos, and transformation - music to listen to while reading, not pop music.

Generate a personalized song for **{personName}** based on their life story extracted from this reading. This must be QUIET, POETIC MUSIC - never nervous or pop-oriented.

---

## CRITICAL RULES

1. ❌ **NO POP MUSIC** - Never nervous, upbeat, or radio-pop style
2. ✅ **EXTRACT**: Character problems, emotional chaos, life struggles, relationship patterns, fears, desires
3. ✅ **MAKE IT EXPLICIT and DRAMATIC** - about their LIFE and EMOTIONS
4. ✅ The person's name (**{personName}**) must appear naturally in lyrics (at least once)
5. ✅ **QUIET, POETIC STYLE** - Always in the tradition of Leonard Cohen, Tom Waits, Bob Dylan, John Prine
6. ✅ **MUSIC TO LISTEN TO** - Introspective, contemplative, poetry set to music
7. ✅ Think: "Hallelujah", "Closing Time", "Like a Rolling Stone", "Angel from Montgomery"

## Research Questions

The reading below is JUST RAW MATERIAL to extract **{personName}'s story**:
- What does {personName} struggle with emotionally?
- What chaos do they live through?
- What relationship patterns destroy them?
- What do they fear most?
- What do they hide from others?
- What makes them feel alive or dead inside?

**Reading Excerpt:**
{readingExcerpt}

---

## STEP 1: PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION & MOOD ANALYSIS

After reading the excerpt, perform a psychological evaluation:
- What is the PRIMARY emotion? (sad, happy, dark, chaotic, triumphant, melancholic, hopeful, angry, peaceful)
- Should this be sung by a MAN, WOMAN, or CHOIR?
- Should this be a SOLO, DUET, or CHOIR performance?

---

## STEP 2: SELECT 70s/80s ARTIST STYLE (Randomly from 50 options)

Randomly select ONE artist from this pool of 50 iconic 70s/80s musicians:

The Who, Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Carole King, Paul Simon, Celine Dion, Bruce Springsteen, ABBA, Aretha Franklin, Fleetwood Mac, Billy Joel, Joni Mitchell, Phil Collins, Whitney Houston, Elton John, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Queen, The Beatles, The Doors, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Donna Summer, Bee Gees, Earth Wind & Fire, Chic, Blondie, Talking Heads, The Clash, The Police, U2, Dire Straits, Genesis, Yes, Rush, Journey, Foreigner, Boston, Kansas, Styx, REO Speedwagon, Heart, Pat Benatar, Cyndi Lauper, Madonna, Prince, Michael Jackson, Tina Turner, Eurythmics, Duran Duran

**CRITICAL**: Even if you select a high-energy artist (like The Who or Rolling Stones), the FINAL EXECUTION must be QUIET and POETIC in the style of Leonard Cohen, Tom Waits, Bob Dylan, or John Prine. This is music to listen to while reading text - never nervous or pop-oriented.

## STEP 3: EXTRACT & WRITE THE LYRICS

Structure (USE MiniMax Music 2.5 structure tags for better arrangement):
- [Intro] (optional, 2 lines)
- [Verse] (4 lines)
- [Chorus] (4 lines)
- [Verse] (4 lines)
- [Chorus] (4 lines)
- [Bridge] (3-4 lines)
- [Chorus] (4 lines)
- [Outro] (optional, 2 lines)

**CRITICAL FORMAT RULE:**
- ✅ USE structure tags: [Intro], [Verse], [Pre Chorus], [Chorus], [Interlude], [Bridge], [Outro], [Hook], [Build Up]
- ✅ These tags help MiniMax Music 2.5 create better arrangements with proper dynamics
- ✅ Use \n to separate lines within sections

**Style Guide:**
- Quiet, introspective, poetic (Leonard Cohen, Tom Waits, Bob Dylan, John Prine)
- Contemplative, not nervous or pop-oriented
- Music to listen to while reading - background, not foreground
- Specific details that feel real and relatable
- NO clichés, NO pop hooks
- Make people FEEL something deep through poetry, not through catchy melodies
